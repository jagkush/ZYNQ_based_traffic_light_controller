# ZYNQ_based_traffic_light_controller
###### A final project for FPGA_SOC course

The project shows a simple demonstration of the Traffic Light Controller using Zynq-7000 xc7z010clg400-1 field programmable gate array (FPGA) board.
This hardware architecture was designed with Vivaldo 2019.1 the Software design kit, and 
Xilinx SDK was used for software logic.
